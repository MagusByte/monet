Monet is a TypeScript library that implements an Entity-Component-System (ECS) framework with a hierarchical structure. It is designed to efficiently manage and traverse entities, their relationships, and associated components. 

Key features include:
- **Entity-Component-System**: A flexible ECS architecture for managing entities and their components.
- **Hierarchy Support**: Built-in support for parent-child relationships between entities.
- **Traversal Utilities**: Tools for visiting and manipulating entities in the hierarchy.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Utilities for working with shapes, enabling easier calculations for positions and spatial relationships.

Monet is ideal for applications requiring structured data storage and traversal, such as simulations, games, or complex data processing systems.
